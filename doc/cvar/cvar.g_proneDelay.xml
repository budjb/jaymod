    <command>g_proneDelay</command>
    enables or disables penalties to players who go prone.  By default, players had to wait
	750 milliseconds between going prone and standing back up with no penalty to their
	accuracy.  With this cvar enabled, players will have an additional delay of 1 second
	(1750 milliseconds total) before they can stand up, and their aim spread will be
	maximized during this period as well.
